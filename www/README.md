See http://www.domoticz.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=4698.

## Introduction

Setting up the frontpage requires some time. Please take a good look at the forum topic mentioned above and the (high level) instructions below.
It will take some time and a lot of trial and error but it is definitely worth it!

## Installation instructions when using domoticz www folder

2) edit frontpage_settings.js
   
2a) edit url of domoticz
   
2b) edit switches (idx, descriptions, etc)

## Installation instructions when using webserver (eg Synology)

## If you have a Sonos
1) Add the Sonos as a dummy switch in Domoticz

2) Check the idx of this switch

3) In the On command of the switch place: http://yourip/folder/frontpage/sonos/index.php?zone=IDX&action=Play (change IDX with the idx of your Sonos in Domoticz)

4) In the Off command of the switch place: http://yourip/folder/frontpage/sonos/index.php?zone=IDX&action=Stop (change IDX with the idx of your Sonos in Domoticz)

5) Edit config.php in sonos folder, fill in the idx and the ip address
